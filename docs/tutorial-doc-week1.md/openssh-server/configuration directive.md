# 4. Configuration Directive

Letâ€™s take a look at an example of a configuration directive change. To make your OpenSSH server display the contents of the /etc/issue.net file as a pre-login banner, you can add or modify this line in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:

*You can also skip these setting.

`PermitRootLogin no`

`PasswordAuthentication no`

Since losing an SSH server might mean losing your way to reach a server, check the configuration after changing it and before restarting the server:

`sudo sshd -t -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

After making changes to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, save the file. Then, restart the sshd server application to effect the changes using the following command:

`sudo systemctl try-reload-or-restart ssh`
