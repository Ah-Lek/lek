# 3. Run the Development Server

To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes.

```
cd my-website
npx docusaurus start
```

By default, a browser window will open at `http://localhost:3000`.

Congratulations! You have just created your first Docusaurus site! Browse around the site to see what's available.
