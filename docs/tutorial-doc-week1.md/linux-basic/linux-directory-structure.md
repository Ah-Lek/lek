# 2. Linux Directory Structure

Linux uses a hierarchical file system, where all files and directories are located under the root directory (/). Below are some common directories and their uses:

- `/`: Root directory, the starting point for all other directories and files.
- `/home`: User directories. Each user typically has a directory here, like /home/username.
- `/bin`: System binary executables and essential command files.
- `/etc`: Configuration files for the system and installed software.
- `/var`: Variable data files, like log files, mail, and cache.
- `/usr`: User programs and data, such as applications and libraries.
- `/tmp`: Temporary files.
