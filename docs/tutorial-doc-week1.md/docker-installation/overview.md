# 1. Overview

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps required to install docker engine on Ubuntu. Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. To get started with Docker Engine on Ubuntu, make sure you meet the prerequisites, and then follow the installation steps.

To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Ubuntu versions:

- Ubuntu Oracular 24.10
- Ubuntu Noble 24.04 (LTS)
- Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 (LTS)
- Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)

Docker Engine for Ubuntu is compatible with x86_64 (or amd64), armhf, arm64, s390x, and ppc64le (ppc64el) architectures. From the previous tutorial, we already install the Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 (LTS).
