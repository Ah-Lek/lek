Learning some common Linux commands is essential for using the system effectively. Here are some basic commands:

## 3.1 File and Directory Operations

- `pwd`: Displays the full path of the current directory.
- `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
    - `ls -l`: Lists files in detailed format.
    - `ls -a`: Lists all files, including hidden files (those starting with `.`).
- `cd <path>`: Changes the current directory to `<path>`. For example, `cd /home/username`.
    - `cd ..`: Moves up one directory level.
    - `cd ~`: Moves to the user's home directory.
- `mkdir <directory>`: Creates a new directory.
- `rmdir <directory>`: Removes an empty directory.
- `rm <file>`: Deletes a file.
    - `rm -r <directory>`: Deletes a non-empty directory and its contents.
    - `rm -f <file>`: Forces deletion of a file, ignoring errors.

## 3.2 Viewing and Manipulating File Contents
- `cat <file>`: Displays the contents of a file.
- `less <file>`: Displays the contents of a file one page at a time, allowing scrolling.

## 3.3 Package Management
In Linux, software is often managed through package managers, which vary by distribution. Common package managers are apt (Ubuntu/Debian), yum (CentOS/RHEL), and dnf (Fedora).

Ubuntu/Debian (APT):
- `sudo apt update`: Updates the package database.
- `sudo apt upgrade`: Upgrades installed packages.
- `sudo apt install <package>`: Installs a package.
- `sudo apt remove <package>`: Removes a package.
