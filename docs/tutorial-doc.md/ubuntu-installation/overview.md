# 1. Overview

Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) widely used for servers, desktops, and embedded devices. Itâ€™s popular among developers and system administrators due to its open-source nature and high customizability. Linux comes in various distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS, each tailored for different use cases and user preferences. Linux's core strength lies in its terminal (command line interface), where users can execute commands to interact with the system directly.
