# 3. Create a Bootable USB Stick

To install Ubuntu Desktop, you need to write your downloaded ISO to a USB stick to create the installation media. This is not the same as copying the ISO, and requires some bespoke software.

For this tutorial, weâ€™ll use [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), as it runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS. Choose the version that corresponds to your current operating system, download and install the tool.

After that, we'll use ISO image for ubuntu, select an image [Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS(Jammy Jellyfissh)](https://mirror.twds.com.tw/ubuntu-releases/jammy/).

Select your downloaded ISO, choose your USB flash drive, and then click Flash! to install your image.
