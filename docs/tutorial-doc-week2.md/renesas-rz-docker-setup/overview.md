# 1. Overview

**Docker** is a software platform that allows you to **build**, **test** and **deploy** applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code and runtime. In order to run the **Renesas RZ/G2L**, you need to copy the files obtained from Renesas into your Linux Host PC. In this tutorial, Renesas VLP needs to be built in an **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system**. If the system is not Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, you can use Docker Containers to build Renesas VLP. If you use vscode for development, you can use Dev Containers to automatically manage Docker Containers.
